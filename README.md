# MMBA - Blockchain is an Accounting System and we are Accountants

Since we are so passionate about the future of both blockchain AND cryptocurrencies, we are allocating significant resources into the blockchain infrastructure through the education and research arms of our advisory.

We believe that private blockchain adoption will occur at a rapid pace in 2019, followed by cryptocurrency adoption. In our opinion, when there is true interoperability between public and private blockchains, this will be the catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption. Once this occurs, MMBA will be uniquely positioned to be your blockchain accountants.
